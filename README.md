# MDT

To automate the setup of MDT I've created all these scripts and configuration Files to setup Microsoft Deployment Toolkit as fast as possible.

# Server Setup
Setup a Windows server OS as you normally do. Set the DVD drive to drive E:. Add a hard disk D: and format it with NTFS.

Run the "Download and install.ps1" script. This script will download MDT, ADK, WinPE and will install WDS on the D: disk.
